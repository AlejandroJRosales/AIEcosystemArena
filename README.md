# AIEcosystemArena
AI Ecosystem Arena is a biologically-inspired simulation of life where autonomous agents explore, survive, and evolve in a continuously generated virtual ecosystem. Each creature operates with a self-controlled neural network brain, learning from its environment in real time. No scripts. No hand-coded paths. Just instinct, memory, and survival.

Agents hunt, drink, reproduce, and avoid predators â€” all driven by evolving traits and reinforcement learning. Health is their lifeblood and currency: eat to thrive, learn to survive, mutate to adapt.

The result? Emergent behavior in a world that grows with them.
